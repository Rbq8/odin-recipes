    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I tripled this recipe. I used reduced fat mayonnaise, dijon mustard and white WINE vinegar in this recipe. My whole family loved these, especially my husband. He said they reminded him of his mother's devilled eggs. He said these would be the ultimate for him if they had a touch of hot sauce. These were inhaled. NOTE: For easy piping, I used a ziploc bag that I spooned the filling into, then cut a corner out of the side of the bag. I just squeezed the egg filling carefully into the egg.
